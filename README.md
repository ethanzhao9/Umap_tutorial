# Umap_tutorial

This repository gives a neat example of how to use umap to do dimensionality reduction.

Demo data is from a Science paper:

Wannan Yang, Chen Sun, Roman Huszár, Thomas Hainmueller, Kirill Kiselev, György Buzsáki. “Selection of experience for memory by hippocampal sharp wave ripple.” Science 383, 1478-1483 (2024).

Tutorial code is based on the the demo code written by Wannan Yang. I want to give a shout-out to her efforts.
